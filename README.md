# Signal-generator
## This Signal Generator is created using Matlab.<br>
### Types of signals you can generate with this program:<br>
1: DC signal.<br>
2: Polynomial Signal.<br>
3: Ramp signal.<br>
4: Sinusoidal Signal.<br>
5: Exponential Signal.<br>
### User could then modify the signal in many ways such as:<br>
1: Scale the signal.<br>
2: Reverse time of the signal.<br>
3: Compressing signal.<br>
4: Time shifting the signal.<br>
5: Expanding the signal.<br>
The modified signal will be displayed immediatly after selecting one of whose modified features.
